I need to fix this markdown in the future.

HTML

What is HTML?
Hiper Text Markup Language.
Not a programming language.
Markup Language for creating webpages / documents.
Building bocks of the Web.

What do I need to start?
Google Chrome.
Mozilla Firefox.
Safari.
Edge.
IE (Please Don't).

A Text Editor (Pick One)
Sublime Text.
Atom.io
Visual Studio Code
Brackets
Notepad++
textMate

Creating an HTML file

Does not need a server
Files must end with .html extension
Runs in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc)
index.html is the root / home page of a website

tag sintax

<tagname>content</tagname>
<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<br/>(self closing)
<br>(Fine in HTML5)

Element names surrounded by angle brackets
Normally come in pairs (start tag and end tag);
End tag is usually the same but with a forward slash
Some tags close themselves (Remanant of XHTML)


HTML5 Semantic Tags

<header></header>
<footer></footer>
<aside></aside>
<main></main>
<article></article>
<nav></nav>
<section></section>
<details></details>

Asemantic tag element clearly describes
its meaning to both the browser and the
developer.
